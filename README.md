# Drum Breaks Anki Deck
Anki Deck for Drum Breaks often used in genres such as Dnb and Breakbeat Hardcore. It comes in two versions, one with example tracks and one without. Feel free to modify the css or js of the cards to your liking.

**Note: this deck is currently incomplete/ a WIP! If you would like to help me with creating it you can drop a message to amenist on discord. Thanks.**

### Example track version
This version of the deck has audio of an example track on the front of the card, and the break audio and info on the back of the card. This is for people who want to hear examples of the breaks being used and maybe find some new music to listen to as well.

### Break only version
This version of the deck has the break audio on the front of the card, and break info on the back of the card. This is for people who only care about the breaks and don't want to hear any usage examples (or maybe you just don't like the tracks I have picked out.)
